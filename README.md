This project is a comprehensive full-stack recipe application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app features CRUD functionality for recipes, supports integration with external APIs, and includes a dynamic form for recipe submissions. It boasts an intuitive UI with RecipeList and RecipeCard components and logic for comparing common ingredients between recipes. Detailed environment variable handling, Axios configuration, and error handling enhance security and reliability. The project also includes best practices for testing and code quality with built-in testing points and linter setup.
